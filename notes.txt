24/10
css:
check if the label already exists/valid before adding
finish editLabel tasks "below"

later:
findout if a checkbox is better than an li
finish the add / delete label in todo
    found a bug: add fetching labels when clicking "add label" button in detailedTodo, 
    always check if the labelsList is empty before fetching, don't fetch if not necessary

.make standard classes in index.css for: 
    backdrops


Later retouches:
    try make the nav buttons like toggle buttons from mui
    improve the loading states when fetching (replace the "loading" with a more suitable message)
    add validation to the signin/out forms
    make a loading state when fetching (labels, todos) (use spinners)
    remake the lable's validation test
    try adding the (deleting automatically after 2days feature) in deleted
    dive into tailwind's state handling, optimize your styles using tailwind

    editLabel:
        decide if to use placeholder or value(with state instead of ref) in editLabel (find the difference in space)
        check if a label with the same name already exists before editing
        start implementing the label feature in the todo:
            add them as chips (check for design ideas)
