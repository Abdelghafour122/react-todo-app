p width is relative to the flex-basis of the todo
alternative icon for labels: MdLocalOffer

THE LABEL COUNT PROBLEM IS ALL ABOUT THE LABELSLIST STATE
CHECK OUT RENDERING/FETCHING/UPDATING THE STATE

later:
findout if a checkbox is better than an li
finish the add / delete label in todo
    found a bug: add fetching labels when clicking "add label" button in detailedTodo, 
    always check if the labelsList is empty before fetching, don't fetch if not necessary

.make standard classes in index.css for: 
    backdrops


Later retouches:
    try make the nav buttons like toggle buttons from mui
    improve the loading states when fetching (replace the "loading" with a more suitable message)
    add validation to the signin/out forms
    make a loading state when fetching (labels, todos) (use spinners)
    try adding the (deleting automatically after 2days feature) in deleted
    dive into tailwind's state handling, optimize your styles using tailwind
    remove the profile popup

    IMPORTANT! Add the validation when editing the labels name

    editLabel:
        decide if to use placeholder or value(with state instead of ref) in editLabel (find the difference in space)

    deleteLabel:
        a label is removed from all todos if deleted

NEW IDEAS:
    ADD A SWITCH FOR GRID LAYOUT/LIST LAYOUT (like in keep)
    ADD AN OFFLINE PAGE, SHOWING THE "connect to internet" MSG
    TRY ADDING BG IMAGES FOR LOG PAGES, OFFLINE PAGE (check out paypal's mobile gb img in offline)
    TODOS WITH BG COLORS
